Christelinda Laureijs is a Master's student at Mount Allison University. Her research project explores the effect of insulin on neuronal activity and synaptic transmission within the dorsomedial hypothalamus. This is a brain region that plays a critical role in appetite regulation and stress responses. Christelinda is also very enthusiastic about R coding and data visualization.
