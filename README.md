# Introduction

This is the repository for my personal website, [https://christelindalaureijs.netlify.app/](https://christelindalaureijs.netlify.app/).

The goal of this website is to better manage my online presence and to present my academic work  all in one place. I also wanted to build and maintain my site independent of external content management systems. The website uses [*blogdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and the [*theme landing page*](https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/landing-page/) of *HugoBlox*. I deployed it using [*Netlify*](https://www.netlify.com/).
