# Introduction

This is the repository for my personal website.

The goal of this website is to better manage my online presence and to present my academic work  all in one place. I also wanted to build and maintain my site independent of external content management systems. The website uses *blogdown* and the *theme landing page* of *HugoBlox*. It will soon be deployed through *Netlify*.
